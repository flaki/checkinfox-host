Check-in Fox Hosted & Authentication
====================================
This application serves the hosted version of the Check-in Fox application
and takes care of the authentication process, too.

The online authentication is needed to prevent the leaking of foursquare
API "secret", which is required by foursquare for any application accessing
their API.
